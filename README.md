# Certificate_Validation_Using_Blockchain

In this project to secure academic certificate and for accurate management and to avoid
forge certificate we are converting all certificates into digital signatures and this digital signature
will be stored in Blockchain server as this Blockchain server support tamper proof data storage
and nobody can hack or alter its data and if by a chance if its data alter then verification get
failed at next block storage and user may get intimation about data alter. In Blockchain
technology same transaction data stored at multiple servers with hash code verification and if
data alter at one server, then it will be detected from another server as for same data hash code
will get different.
For example, in Blockchain technology data will be stored at multiple servers and if
malicious users alter data at one server, then its hash code will get changed in one server and
other servers left unchanged and this changed hash code will be detected at verification time
and future malicious user changes can be prevented. In Blockchain each data will be stored by
verifying old hash codes and if old hash codes remain unchanged then data will be considered
as original and unchanged and then new transaction data will be appended to Blockchain as new
block. For each new data storage all blocks hash code will be verified.
